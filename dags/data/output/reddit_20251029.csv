1oi9i97,Should I just give up on programming / IT ?,"My story: I graduated in 2022 as a CSE (3.5 years long bachelor's degree) but I was unable to get a job. I come from a rural area so I quickly gave up on searching and settled elsewhere. I worked various jobs in the last 3 years. I didn't like any of them. It seems like I just can't find my place.

Sometimes I think about moving to the city and working as a programmer but the reality is nobody would want to hire me. I was unhirable in 2022, and it's gotten much worse since 2022.

I knew getting a degree alone was not going to be enough to hired, and I knew side projects (github portfolio) and internship were important. I knew that since like 2019 or 2020 (I was still a student) but university was super overwhelming to me. I felt burnt out during university. I had no time and energy to build a portfolio.

Now I have a full time job (a job that I don't like) and I am doing a weekend university that is related to my current job so I don't have much time. I will have more time when I finish this bullshit university.

But the thing is, I just do not see myself getting hired even if I code 15-20 hours every week for a year as a hobby. The market seems so oversaturated and it seems that if you don't have a cool internship coming out of university, your career is done.

1oiajqj,Tips for Retaining DSA Knowledge?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been studying Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and I feel like I understand the concepts and how they work, but I quickly forget them over time. I practice exercises, but after a few months, much of what I learned fades away, even though I don’t have this problem with other topics.

I’m curious to know how other people managed to learn DSA effectively. Did you follow any specific study patterns, techniques, or routines that helped you retain the knowledge long-term?

For context, I’m currently following Abdul Bari’s Udemy course.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",8,5,MerlinDaWizzard,learnprogramming,4260784,2025-10-28 14:15:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oiajqj/tips_for_retaining_dsa_knowledge/,False,False,False,False,0,"['Honestly, it\'s just practice. Solve some problems that require you to think algorithmically (Advent of Code is one of my favorites) and practice DSA with those questions and you\'ll be good. The key to learning DSA, in my opinion, is not just how to write an algorithm it in a programing language, but understanding the underlying concept. So, if you know how a hash table works, if you know how to explain binary search in detail, if you can visualize the call stack when doing recursive binary search or merge sort, then I think you\'re good to go and you shouldn\'t worry if you forget syntax. If you forget the underlying concept, then I think you should just try to practice more by yourself and force yourself to think. So, if you get an exercise that says ""sort this array using bubble sort"", then instead of just using the memorized bubble sort implementation that you have in your head and then going to your code editor, instead open up a notion document or a google docs and write pseudocode or go to excalidraw and draw some diagrams to visualize bubble sort with 0 code so that you can make sure that before you implement it in your programming language of choice that you actually understand the concept and you\'re not just using the memorized implementation of bubble sort that you saw in a course. That\'s usually what I like to do, make sure I can analyze and explain the concept BEFORE I implement it in code.', 'Solve the problems yourself.\n\nIf you\'re like watching/reading a course and just replicating their solutions the knowledge will always slide off of you.\n\nIf you sit there working at a problem for a few hours before you figure out the solution yourself, you\'ll probably never forget it and even if you do you\'ll have developed the problem solving muscles needed to solve it much faster in the future.\n\nFor like really optimal solutions you\'re unlikely to derive those by yourself, but if you\'ve worked out the more basic solutions from scratch the optimizations will be much easier to remember.\n\nLike, honestly, I suspect a lot of people who are a few years from college don\'t remember off the top of their head how to do a breadth first search of a graph. But I\'d expect anyone who is a competent programmer to be able to sit for a second, think about what they need to do and what order they need to do it in, and then go and start working it out. Even if you never went to college and never learned about graphs, if you\'re decently smart and have had graphs explained to you, it shouldn\'t take you long to figure out an approach that works.\n\nMost DSA questions are really two parts - ""What approach will solve this problem?"" and then ""How do I implement that?""

1ohv7z8,Internship Troubles,"Hello!

I've been interning at a company for around 5 months now and I'm having a tough time honestly. I was hoping I could get some thoughts from people who've been where I have and pushed through it.

When I started, the company made it clear that they expected nothing from me, which I found a bit strange and it made me feel like my work didn't matter from the start. I was given my first project and I completed it in a month, I told my supervisor this and his reaction seemed more annoyed than pleased, and he said he would have to find something else for me to do if I don't slow down. He also explained that I had completed it much quicker than they expected (~3/4 months ahead of schedule). This made me feel great at the time; looking back, I fear they were just underestimating me.

I tried to take some initiative. I taught myself to write cleaner code, did some reading, tried to push the idea behind my first project further and add some extra features while I had no other projects or tasks lined up.

I eventually asked my supervisor for some more work and he put me onto doing bug fixes. I was happy at the time because it was helping me learn much more about the codebase, about the products they sell and I was making a difference, but 3 months later and there still wasn't any more projects lined up. I spoke to a couple of my friends also away on internships and they seem to be busy, with multiple projects waiting and with deadlines. It hurts even more when I see other members of staff working on projects I feel I would me more than capable of assisting them with and when I offer to help, they turn me away.

There have been monthly stand-ups where they joke about forgetting I'm there, I haven't had a single code review in the 5 months and when I ask management, they say they've been very busy. This makes me feel even more demoralized because if they're busy, why can't they get me to help?

Additionally, I just feel like I don't deserve to be there and like I'm expendable. My manager constantly jokes about how stupid people from my university are and I do try and laugh it off but it keeps making me feel even worse about being there. I even recall cases where they've been annoyed about me asking for help!

I've contemplated trying to leave in favour of another intenrship, but I don't think it's possible to find another at this time in the year and I can't imagine me leaving 8 months early would look good on my resume. I feel trapped and like I'm not improving at all.

Have any of you been in an internship like this?

I would appreciate all your thoughts and opinions on this as I'm really struggling.

Much faster, much easier, much cleaner code. I tried all IDEs with graphical GUI builders and the only one that produced half-way readable and maintainable code was Eclipse Window Builder pro. Both, Netbeans and IntelliJ produced unmaintainable code that broke on the faintest change."", ""I remember that. I like Qt Creator and Godot for letting me drag stuff around. But I do not like to work on other people's projects in those things.\n\nThere are a few fundamental tradeoffs here:\n\nThe code is the truth. Whatever the wysiwyg editor makes must translate to code. Whatever the code says must be presentable by the wysiwyg editor. This usually breaks down as soon as you do something with the code that the wysiwyg editor can not handle, like some custom widget for example. To make that work you have to write extra code just to make the wysiwyg editor compatible with your code again.\n\nOn the flip side a lot of the frontend code has structure that the wysiwyg editor can not show. DOM has a box model that doesn't allow you to simply drag/drop a button anywhere. The only way to do that is to position it with absolute. You wouldn't do that because it breaks responsiveness with different view-ports. Instead you would work with padding, margins, grid layouts etc to get the desired effect - but the wysiwyg cannot show that. It can only hint at that.\n\nThis in turn usually leads to people who're used only to the wysiwyg editor to forget about the underlying structure. There's plenty of precedent for that. LaTeX for example is about code representing structured text and styles to render headlines differently than normal text, Microsoft Word simply allows you to make text large and bold to emulate a heading. But the loss of structure also means you can't do the other stuff LaTeX can do like creating content listings and reducing page breaks immediately after headings. Designers who create mockups in Figma _can_ do really great work, or they can simply slap some shapes there and call it a day. But since the code will be the truth eventually, someone has to translate those shapes into the structure anyway.\n\nLastly, the people who work with code all day have a different problem than the people who rely mainly on wysiwyg editors. Graphical user interfaces are about discoverability of features and a quick preview of the final product. Material pipelines in Blender for example work very well as boxes connected with wires. \n\nCode has about information density, and is easier to work with. No graphical tool can fit as much information on a screen as well written text. Copy and pasting text works between tons of editors, but copy and pasting graphical elements only works in the same tool. You can check text into version control and get diffs or even move detection, that doesn't work for graphical elements unless it compiles to text first.""]"

You\'re not learning how to USE the language, and they\'re not teaching you problem solving skills. Your programming classes give you some context for your other classes - computation theory, DSA, applied mathematics... It also gives you some exposure - this is the job, staring at a screen, walls of text, arbitrary decisions, bastard bugs. Is this something you want to do all day, every day, for the next 45 years?\n\nWhen you graduate, your education didn\'t finish, it only just begun. You don\'t pop out an expert. The end of college is only the beginning of the rest of your life. WE KNOW you don\'t know shit. THAT is why we hire junior developers - not because you\'re cheap, not because we couldn\'t afford a senior, but because juniors tend to multiply the force of a senior, because we can mold you into what you need to be successful here.\n\nI\'ll bet when you\'re done with this semester you couldn\'t actually tell me what OOP even is or adequately demonstrate it. It\'s not a judgement on you - all programming and college courses are saturated with dogmas and traditions. They call it an OOP course but don\'t actually teach it, typically because your professors don\'t actually know, either.\n\nSo when you graduate, your programming experience isn\'t terribly relevant. C++, Python... What I need to know is how you think, if you can learn and adapt. Can I mold you into the person I need here to solve our problems? Ostensibly, the answer is ""yes"", so the major difference between you and another candidate is not what you ""know"", but the aptitude you both demonstrate. Obviously I\'m going to hire the one with the greater potential, insofar as my hiring process can deduce. We don\'t have great tools for this - your GPA is SOMETHING but only tells a particular kind of story. It can mean you can learn a lot and make connections, or it can mean you can memorize the material long enough to ace a test. So GPA alone isn\'t enough. Your personality also counts for something - can I see myself working with you for the next 5 years? Are you going to mesh well with the personality of the team? You don\'t have to be smarter than the other guy to be the better fit.\n\nOnce you get hired here, we\'ll teach you what you need to know to be successful. So don\'t sweat it. If you\'re hired, it means you\'re good enough, you\'ve got the right stuff, and that we want to build you up and see you succeed. We know that\'s going to take time.\n\nWatch out for puppy mills - places that want junior graduates to also paradoxically have 3-5 years experience. That\'s not junior, that\'s not entry level. Also, if a company doesn\'t hire you - they\'re doing you a favor. Often it\'s because it\'s not a good fit - and that there is a TWO-WAY street. You DO NOT want to work for a place you don\'t fit in, that kind of misery WILL take years off your life.\n\nSo focus on your fundamentals, your problem solving skills, and your joy of the craft. A good GPA won\'t hurt, either. Very quickly, the programming language fades away, and becomes a tool, a means to an end - you won\'t even see the code anymore. What you\'ll see is the problem before you, and your solution will be sculpted and painted - the epitome of elegance.', 'Depends what u want to do specifically alot, but cpp is used in alot of programming fields plus teaches you memory management which is good', 'Other language C++ is cool, but me personally, I’d choose something else.']"

1oihf2p,Clarification regarding prefix sum problem,"Hi, I was learning prefix sums and came across this problem: MINVOTE

>There are N minions who are competing in an election of the president of the ACM (Association of Cute Minions). They are standing in a line in the order from minion 1 to minion N. For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), the i-th minion has an influence level of Si. 

>A single minion may cast any number of votes. Minion j will vote for minion i (i ≠ j) if and only if the influence level of the j-th minion is greater than or equal to the sum of influence levels of all the minions standing between them (excluding the i-th and j-th minion).

>Your task is to find the number of votes received by each minion.



>**Example case 1**: N = 4, S = \[4, 3, 2, 1\]. The official explanation given is:

>*The second minion will get votes of the first and third minion.*

>*The third minion will get votes of the first, second and fourth minion.*

>*The fourth minion will get votes of the second and third minion.*

But why is this? Should the first minion not get the vote of the 3rd minion as well, since S\[1\] = 4 > 3? Similarly, shouldn't the second minion get the vote of the 4th minion? The official answer for this test case is \[1, 2, 3, 2\] but my code produces \[2, 3, 2, 1\].

1oierwj,How to find minimum number of days for a schedule according to a preference via graph?,"Hi everyone. I am tasked with a question as follows:

We have n players and we want to hold a wrestling tournament with exactly n \* (n - 1) / 2 matches. In each day a player can only play at most one match. However, each player has a certain preference when it comes to playing others. Here is an input example:

```
4
4 2 3
3 4 1
2 4 1
1 2 3
```

In this example player 1 wants to play against 4 2 3 in order. This means that they want to play against player 4 before they play against 2 and so on. I am supposed to find a **graph** based solution which prints out the least number of days it takes to plan such a tournament or print -1 if it cannot be done.

My solution has been to create a preference queue for each player. Then for each day build a preference graph where edge (u, v) exists if and only if v is the front of the preference queue of edge u. Then I use DFS to extract all cycles of length 2. These cycles represent two players who are willing to play each other and I add the pair to a linked list called 'match'. Then I dequeue the preference queue's of said pair and continue to do so until either everyone plays against the players' they want  to play against or we reach an impossible solution where no two players want to play against each other, in said case such schedule is impossible. The worst case running of this algorithm is Θ(n^3) and its best case is Θ(n^2) which unfortunately causes time limits when submitting so either the algorithm itself is not the best or it could be implemented better.

```

Our TA says that there is a solution which always runs in Θ(n^2) and that we must utilize topological sort. However, I cannot see how topological sort can help us here. If we use topological sort on each of the preference graphs then it's essentially the same as DFS. If we use it on the full graph where each vertex is connected to every other vertex, I don't see how that can help us either. I would like some help here as I have been stuck on this question for a while.

The question gives us the value of n on the first line. Then for the n following lines we will have n - 1 numbers representing the preference of each player. For instance, the given example given at the start is interpreted as:

```
n = 4
1: 4 > 2 > 3
2: 3 > 4 > 1
3: 2 > 4 > 1
4: 1 > 2 > 3

1oi4eut,Need everyone's advice on future direction for 1.5 years experienced C++ developer,"Hi everyone,
I’m 24 years old and currently a junior C++ developer. I work at a Vietnamese software company that outsources projects for Japan. My job is to develop C++ services for Flutter-based car apps.

Recently, my previous project was cut by the Japanese client, so I got transferred to a new one. In this new project, I’m mainly handling the handover of an old C++ app built with the client’s internal framework. However, I feel that this framework isn’t very valuable in terms of transferable knowledge — the Japanese side doesn’t even use it anymore (they’ve switched to Flutter for newer models).

Right now, I’m feeling pretty lost because I don’t think I’ll grow much technically if I keep working like this. I’m currently interviewing at a company that uses Golang and microservices.
Should I switch to that direction to look for more opportunities? I’d really appreciate your advice.

1oi3g9d,What do I need to learn for my project,"Hello I am a software engineering student who wants to get an early start on his graduation project. My idea is to create a mobile app that helps manage educational facilities (schools, universities, etc.) which is something very lacking in my country.

After asking around online I learnt that such idea will need to have a GUI that is decoupled from the backend so for example any place that wants to implement this can do so with minimal changes they just need to plug in their own database. How can I and what should I learn to achieve this?

I will most likely be learning dart and using flutter to create the app but idk what else I will need.  
I will appreciate any advice or suggestions

for some extra context: The teacher who is supposed to be my advisor suggested to me the worst project idea I have ever heard so I want to convince him to switch to something else so I want to make sure I understand what I am trying to do so A. i dont bite off more than I can chew B. It will be easier to convince him if i understand what are the tools that I will be using

For the back end, that's when you'll learn something like, for example, Java Spring Boot. There's a lot of backend frameworks, so this is something that you would research. Then you would need a database to store all your data into. Because where would the accounts of various users be stored into? An example would be PostgreSQL. Now, you would configure both the front end and back end to communicate with each other. First, locally. Then hosted within the school's network. This is basically where you would collaborate with the school's board or faculty or IT group. Of course, you would ideally pitch this idea to the school first if they approve it, then you start making the app. \n\nLastly, deployment. This one I don't really know too much about, but it's in regards to how your backend gets deployed. Or maybe your frontend as well if you plan to also create a web build of it.\n\nUnless I miss something, this is a high level explanation of what you would do for an account management system, that holds information of each user that may include their class level, class name, teacher, course, etc."", '> ""make an app that can create a timetable for lectures for a university using AI technology""\n\nWhy do you think that this was the ""worst project idea I have ever heard""?\n\nScheduling is far from a trivial task.

1oi0gn9,Epoll Proxy design questions,"Hi there,

This is my first time posting on this subreddit. If you think my question is better answered in other subreddits, please let me know.

So my last project was creating a [multi threaded web server in C](https://github.com/navrajkalsi/server-c).

Now for my next project, I want to take the next logical step and use **epoll**  and implement it to create a proxy in C. I have been researching and have started to code, but there is just so much to reason (at least for me) and think about with epoll when comparing to threads.

The proxy will **only deal with one host (upstream)**, so I do not need to call `getaddrinfo()` which blocks. I will be storing host info before `epoll_wait()`.

Today after scratching my head all day, I decided to create a diagram to help myself and ask if there are any mistakes in design and, more importantly, do I even understand epoll correctly?

Please look at the linked diagram and let me know if you see any mistakes and /or bad practices, or just suggestions to make it better.

One thing right of the bat, that I know will be tricky to implement, the timeout for keep-alive after response is sent to the client. Do you have any suggestions how to implement that?

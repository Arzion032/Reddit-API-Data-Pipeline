1oghzxt,I'm currently learning with AI and I feel like I'm a fraud.,"I keep seeing posts that contain a sentence similar to this. Let me give some generic advice: try doing it without AI.

In the olden times, it was not uncommon for learners to have a project that did not work, and they could not figure out why. Now, thanks to AI, learners have a project that does work, and they can't figure out why.

AI is not always bad or evil, but likewise, it definitely isn't always helpful. Learning requires reading, trying, making mistakes, getting confused, reading more, trying more, and repeating. 

Start small -- there's a reason ""hello world"" is a common first task -- the actual coding is ridiculously simple, but it proves that your have done all of the necessary work to get your environment properly running. Once you've got that working, you can move on to something more complicated.

I've seen a lot of people who, with the help of AI, start with a much bigger project. AI helps them get that bigger project running, but they don't fully understand what was done to reach that point, which means they're not able to successfully make changes or fixes to that project.

There's nothing wrong with googling. There's nothing wrong with asking AI a question. But your best bet is to spend some time thinking and trying on your own before using either tool. My advice to anyone learning with AI: don't let AI read or write your code. If you're going to ask AI questions, do so in English. Use AI to help you find the terminology that you don't yet know, and once you've learned the right words, spend some time reading about what they mean.

To be clear, I don‚Äôt want this done for me. I want to learn how. But I‚Äôm so far out of the loop with modern tech, I don‚Äôt even know which questions to ask yet. I‚Äôm afraid if I just plow in, I‚Äôll waste a ton of time on stuff I didn‚Äôt need to look at.

If the website is static (all content is sent upfront with the HTML), then I agree with the other commentor. I'd use Python, with `requests` to fetch the page and `BeautifulSoup` to parse it to get the data out.\n\nIf it's dynamic (Javascript is executed in the browser to fetch the actual content that you care about), that won't work. You'll need a tool like Selenium (basically, it allows you to control a browser via Python) which is capable of executing Javascript.\n\nYou can tell how the site is populated by opening the dev-tools and comparing the Elements and Sources tabs.

Others have suggested python, I'd do the same. Look into [requests.get\\(\\)] (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_requests_get.asp) then look into the [response you get from there] (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_requests_response.asp) and then just search the body for the name that you're looking for.\n\nUnless, again like others have said, the webpages you're scraping are dynamic. Then it's not as straightforward, but very possible and quite easy to figure out where the data is coming that you actually want to search using your browser's dev tools. Say you're visiting funerals.com or whatever, but the site actually fetches its data from funerals.com/funerals?start=2025-10-24&end=2525-10-25 and populates the website dynamically.\n\nNow you have the API (application programming interface) endpoint and you can just fetch that data instead of the whole website.\n\nOnce you have that working, you can look into cronjobs or scheduled tasks, if you're on windows, to make your script run automatically at specified times and then look into notifications.

1ogi19e,Is the change from Motion Design to Front-end worth it?,"Hey everyone

I‚Äôve been working as a video editor and motion designer for over five years now. I really enjoy what I do, but lately, I‚Äôve been feeling a bit stuck. That excitement to learn something new just isn‚Äôt there anymore.

I also don‚Äôt really see a clear path where I could grow financially and build a good life for myself and my family. So, I decided it‚Äôs time for a change, and that‚Äôs where coding comes in.

I‚Äôve always been interested in both coding and design. I have a degree in Design, and I even created a personal UI project just because I love building interfaces.

Now I‚Äôm thinking about learning front-end development and mixing it with my motion design and UI skills to make my profile more interesting for companies and hopefully find better opportunities out there.

And who knows, maybe later I‚Äôll dive into back-end too, because even though I work in a creative field, I‚Äôve always been quite a technical person at heart.

1oggdsz,General questions about frontends and gui,"I'm programming mostly just for fun. I started with Python but now I'm doing most of my coding in Go (sometimes I try out other languages like C or Rust).

I understand the logic of command line tools or lets say backend programming but I struggle when I want to do a GUI. In Go I did one small project where I used Fyne for the GUI. But the documentation and how to structure the program was difficult, I made it work but the code i a mess.

Sometimes I can't find a good a library to do something I need in Go, then I do it in Python or Rust. But I don't want to learn how to program a GUI in every language.

  
Now I have some general questions. Would it be easier if I split the GUI/frontend and the backend? 

For example, should I program a rest api in Go (or whatever languages I want to use at the moment) and then learn something like Flutter or React to do the GUI?

Is Flutter easy to learn and does it make sense if I mostly want to do desktop applications?

* Be able to make multiple ""pages""

1og20y0,FPGA Class - In need of assistance,"Hello. I am new to Reddit and this is my first ever post. Sorry for the weird default name and stuff.

I made this account due to falling behind quite a bit in my second-ever class that is centered around FPGAs and my first ever class centered around Hardware Description Languages (Verilog, VHDL, SysVerilog).

I have tried to get help in this course from the course staff; however, the help they have provided is minimal. I keep getting redirected to resources that I have already tried to help me get back on track. This is the last place I thought I could reach out to for assistance.

**Specifically**, I am behind on labs for this class. For each of my projects in this course, there always seems to be something wrong with them. I try debugging using RTL simulations, and while the information provided in incredibly useful, I really can't narrow down to what specifically is causing the issue in my code let alone implement a solution such that my Hardware Descriptions properly describe the hardware that I am building.

This has been exacerbated by unavoidable personal life events related to death, illness, and housing. I have deprioritized other classes and have put myself in jeopardy in many of my other classes just so I could try to salvage this class as I find the material to be extremely interesting. With all of this in mind, my TA has deprioritized those who are behind (me) in favor of those who are closest to lab completion of current labs. While I was given an extra time, it feels like I was given a hot potato or a ticking time bomb more than anything after I have learned of this context that initially I knew nothing about up until around 1-2 weeks ago.

**Currently,** I am working on one highly important, late lab. I‚Äôm at risk of losing credit for a lot of labs if I don‚Äôt finish soon. What I am working on is a structural ALU implemented via HDL's in Quartus. I have since  proceeded to work on my Verilog version as it is what I expect to be able to complete before the end of this weekend given my other coursework that I now must catchup on.

In the image below, I have included a screenshot of what my RTL simulation over places where my function select is producing erroneous results (SHRA, SHRL, RRC, LD operations)

[SHRA, SHRL, RRC, LD](https://preview.redd.it/kvlumtszcbxf1.png?width=1870&format=png&auto=webp&s=46a178adc2432987cb532ca2f0a8a35a07ce0182)

Currently, my arithmetic unit, logic unit, and const unit all seem to work (all green, seems to all be okay in RTL).

[MY SR\_UNIT](https://preview.redd.it/c9a5h7zwdbxf1.png?width=1798&format=png&auto=webp&s=b33e3fe2f7fd8bab86a37d055cf0bd6f4f32db98)

What I know is incorrect is my SR unit, as this unit is not properly producing the results I intended it to (SHRL, SHRA, RRC). I noticed that the numbered versions work perfectly; however, the shrl, shra, and rrc are not being assigned. This is in spite of me assigning them using the ternary operator \`\`\`(thing) ? (iftrue) : (iffalse)\`\`\`

[Results MUX && CNVZ MUX](https://preview.redd.it/gnc0ckn9ebxf1.png?width=1794&format=png&auto=webp&s=db20ebfcb3091dae2002ca88ca8d74f3940b79f0)

These components behave well most of the time. I suspect that when SR\_UNIT properly works, these will all fall into place alongside it.

[Top Level](https://preview.redd.it/a6pnkzmgebxf1.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=828a09a3b44b6916f24cc83c6af70fcab85b3bac)

Mostly works excluding the stuff mentioned earlier about the operation codes/func\_sel. The main issue here is CIN, which I believe I am not assigning a value in the top level. I have been confused on what I am actually supposed to do here with this cin anyways. The main reason I have it is because the given testbench requires it, and since all my SHIFT/ROTATE operations require a CIN & a COUT at some level.

I did not notice that my LD function (1011) was non-functional, and I need to look back to see where it would likely be stored in my code.

Clang-format is popular. Save the formatter configuration to your project so that even if the formatter changes, the formatting itself remains consistent within the project. (Clang-format changes it's formatting defaults with every update. It's annoying as shit.) Let's not argue whether the asterisk goes here or there, whether the bracket goes on the same line or the next...\n\nSecond - this program ostensibly works, so there's not much to argue about there. Who cares about cleanliness?\n\nThird - is this good code? Not remotely. You've got a lot of learning to go through, it's clear you're very early in your introductory material. I'll warn you that the materials you're learning from are teaching you grammar and syntax - they're NOT teaching you how to USE the language. You still have to learn algorithms and data structures, the theory of computation, types, and idioms and paradigms. Then for whatever problem you want to solve, you have to learn that domain. For example, if you want to make video games, to start - you have to learn linear algebra - the math of 2D and 3D.\n\nSo I don't really know what to tell you other than keep going. A lot of what I would knock will simply go away once you learn more language concepts.\n\nTips:\n\nThe most important part of C++ is the type system. Types are everything. C++ is famous for its type safety, but if you don't use it, you don't get the benefit. In C++, an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`, even if you implement it in terms of `int`. It takes a while to get good at types. You can define your own User Defined Types - they are `struct`, `class`, `union`, and `enum`. The standard library is full of user defined types, because `std::vector` is not defined by the language itself as a primitive, like `int`, or implementation type, like GCC's `__int128`. Even something like a vector isn't something you should be using directly, but be building your own types in terms of.\n\nTypes will let you solve for a lot of problems. For example, IO is all about types with custom stream operators; I post about this often in r/cpp_questions.\n\nTypes will prevent aliasing, because:\n\n    void fn(int &, int &);\n\nYou don't know which parameter is which, and the compiler can't know if the parameters are aliased or not - so the function has to be implemented sub-optimally, with memory fences and writebacks to ensure correctness.\n\n    void fn(weight &, height &);\n\nThe types are preserved in the ABI, and the rule is two different types cannot coexist in the same place at the same time; these parameters CAN'T be aliased, so the compiler is free to generate more optimal code. Type safety isn't just about catching bugs, compilers are theorem provers, and that allows them to optimize. Compilers optimize most around types.\n\nTypes will help you push more of your code into compile-time instead of runtime. For example - you have code that checks the deposit amount is between the min and the max, but you have to test for that at runtime. If instead you had types:\n\n    using deposit = std::variant<std::monostate, valid, below_min, above_max>;\n\nYou have types that can prove correctness at compile-time. Instead of the `deposit` function printing all that output, these types know how to print themselves, their own messages at deposit. In this way, your function can express WHAT to do, and your implementation details can express HOW.\n\nJust as primitive types exist for you to build more expressive, more elaborate, more abstract, more composite types, so too do we have control structures as primitives you are to build your algorithms out of. I haven't written a `for` loop in over 10 years, and neither should you. Algorithms name your loops and raise your expressiveness.\n\nYour functions are huge. All the major software houses and independent researchers have done the work and have found again and again that the best programmers in the world can't keep track of over 100 LOC. If you can't see the top of your function when looking at the bottom, it's probably too long. You can describe `deposit` as a series of sub-steps. Those sub-steps can be named... Just like... A function...\n\nContinued..."", 'Rather than this code:\n\n    bool entered;\n    char task;\n    \n    std::cout << ""- - - ATM - - -\\n"";\n    entered = _authentication();\n    ...\n\nI would prefer to write that code as follows only because it reduces the total line count:\n\n    char task;\n    \n    std::cout << ""- - - ATM - - -\\n"";\n    bool entered = _authentication();\n    ...\n\nBut naturally that is nothing more than a personal preference of a particular coding style.']"

I‚Äôm currently learning NLP (Natural Language Processing) and want to build a small chatbot project in Python. I‚Äôve heard that both NLTK and spaCy are important for text processing, but I‚Äôm a bit confused about where to start and how to structure my learning.

Could someone please share a roadmap or learning order for mastering NLTK and spaCy? Like:

What concepts should I learn first?

Which library should I focus on more (NLTK or spaCy)?

Any good tutorials, YouTube channels, or course recommendations?

Should I also learn Hugging Face transformers later on, or is that overkill for now?


My current background:

Comfortable with Python  and data structures

Learning Pandas and NumPy

Goal: Build an NLP chatbot (text-based, maybe later with a simple UI)

1ogihz6,Need help choosing a solid topic for my School project (wanna make it practical too),"Hey folks,  
I‚Äôm in a group for some course, and we‚Äôre at the stage of submitting our inception report. It‚Äôs mostly documentation (scope, requirements, risks, WBS, etc.), but I want to choose a topic that‚Äôs not just theoretical ‚Äî something I can later turn into a real, practical project with angluar.js and asp.net.

I was initially interested in ideas that mix management systems (for the main part) with a small machine learning feature ‚Äî like 70% management features, 30% smart prediction or analytics.

For example, one idea I liked was a Project Management Dashboard for organizations handling multiple projects at once.  
There‚Äôd be:

* Project managers overseeing progress,
* Team leads handling task-level stuff,
* Developers logging updates,
* And the system could give ‚Äúsmart insights‚Äù like warning about potential delays or resource bottlenecks.

I also brainstormed another concept around pregnancy and hospital management, where doctors are assigned to patients, incidents are logged, and the system provides insights to specialists ‚Äî but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs too niche or already done to death. And i really don't think there is a gap in this area...

So yeah ‚Äî I‚Äôm looking for topic suggestions that:

* Are realistic enough to plan and document like a full project,
* Could later be built as a real system,
* Maybe have a small data-driven or ML twist,
* And don‚Äôt sound like the same old ‚Äústudent project template.‚Äù

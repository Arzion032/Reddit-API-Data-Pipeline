1oj1nr8,I got stuck faster than expected,"Hey everyone, I’m a CS major on my sophomore year, and I’ve been a victim of this rising phenomenon where students rely extremely on Ai tools to generate code and do assignments therefore outsourcing their brains and ending up with no foundation.

1oiwnd1,Where do I put Unit Tests?,"From my understanding unit testing ensures a partcular piece of code works by passing input and getting the correct output back, and continues to work long after. However, i'm still unsure about where it's needed.

For example if you have a function that calculates the square root of a number, it's quite easy to unit test. But is that really necessary? 

Just check it once and you can be essentially sure that it'll work perfectly forever (until a vibecoder modifies it for some reason). After all there's no reason to change it now or ever.
Won't unit tests be overkill for this?

What about functions and classes that are simple to understand/debug/modify? Should unit tests only be done for more complex code/frequently modified code?

And if something needs unit tests how many should I do? Should I try to cover all the edge cases? Or just the common ones that are easy to break.

Finally, what scope should unit tests be? It's probably not a good idea to make unit tests for each function, but what about per class? Should it be done per system instead?

thanks!",41,17,LilBluey,learnprogramming,4261006,2025-10-29 05:49:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oiwnd1/where_do_i_put_unit_tests/,False,False,False,False,0,"['Let\'s take the square root example.\n\nIf your function is just calling sqrt(x) and returning, then no that\'d be silly to unit test - but then again why would you have such a function in the first place?\n\nLet\'s say the function is actually computing the square root using Newton\'s Method. Then wouldn\'t you want to test that it works? You could easily have a bug in your code. What if it works most of the time but fails for small numbers? What if it crashes if you give it a negative number?\n\nUnit tests can be useful for this sort of thing - trying a wide range of inputs to a function to ensure it works correctly.\n\nAs far as where to put them, the standard practice is to make them part of the same repository and to make an easy way to run all of your tests. The idea is that every time you change your code, you run all of your tests and make sure you didn\'t break anything.\n\nSo that brings up the second value of unit tests - they catch future problems. Suppose you want to speed up your code by using SIMD instructions to speed up math. You could rewrite your square root function and then re-run the unit tests to make sure it still gives the correct answer.\n\nThere\'s no rule for how many tests you need, but one goal that a lot of people strive for is to cover every line of code with at least one test. So if your function has an ""if"" statement in it at the top level, you\'d need at a minimum two tests to cover it - one test that covers the true branch, and one test that covers the false branch.\n\nThere are tools that will run your tests and tell you exactly which lines were and weren\'t covered by tests.\n\nFinally, as to what to test, unit tests are generally for testing individual functions. A good rule of thumb is to test all of the public interface of any class. So if there are some helper functions inside of a file that can\'t be called from anywhere else, you don\'t have to test those, but you should test whatever public functions or methods other parts of your code might be able to call.\n\nTesting systems is also a good idea, but then they\'re not called unit tests, they\'re called something else, like integration tests. They tend to have different tradeoffs, like they\'re usually slower so you can\'t have as many of them, and you might care more about the tests being robust than them being comprehensive.', 'Looking at your example specifically, A square root function could have plenty of side effects you’d want to test, and they may not be related to the math. Like logging abnormal inputs. If you replace your logging provider 3 years from now, you may forget about the log message until it breaks. Unit tests help catch that, if you have a test ensuring a log message is written properly. \n\n All of the following questions could be behavior you want to test so a) you know it’s working as designed, and b) you know it continues to work every time you run the tests.\n\n- depending on how strict the type system is for your language, what happens when the user enters “fish” or the string “42”, rather than the number 42?\n- What if the user provides a negative number - how do you want to handle that? Do you check the input before the calculation and exit gracefully? Or attempt it anyway?\n- Do you support the imaginary portion, or do you throw an exception? \n- What exception do you throw, and what is the message?\n- you may want to know if the input was abnormal or caused an error, do you have logging? You can unit test that a log message was emitted. \n- what happens when you provide 0? Or the largest input number? Or the smallest input number.\n- does it handle fractions correctly?\n- if it’s a sensitive calculation, you may care about the precision of the result - is that correct?', 'I think that you gave the perfect example on why to write unittests.\n\nSome vibe coder might change it for some reason. \n\nYour tests protect the production code from this kind of regression.', 'Lot\'s of good answers on the technical implementation but I think some things were left unanswered.\n\n1. How many people are working on the code\n2. What is the domain\n\nIf you are working on your own you can think more greedily about your own productivity. For example, only create tests when you start developing something and you know it\'s going to be annoying to test manually (like someone mentioned, a reimplementation of calculating a square root). Another good point to write some tests is before a big refactor.\n\nOnce there are more people working on the project it makes sense to add tests to provide some stability to the project. Most contributors are not able to test a project comprehensively, often code lacks the proper data to test the program, and tests can provide that. In general, a small team of experienced developers can work with less tests, only adding tests were it truly makes development easier. Once you go into bigger organizations or open source you will need more tests, because there is going to be people whose main task is to review and merge code and their life is made so much easier with tests.\n\nSecond, what is the project? I\'ve seen application UI code has usually less tests because a lot of the output is visual. Sure there are some methods like monitoring visuals changes, or component libraries where you can click though individual components. Something as simple as just checking all components render can be a good enough test. But in general the passing test for UI is that it looks good and is usable, and that needs more often than not some manual testing anyway.\n\nData processing oriented code, infrastructure code, and code that has difficult inputs or outputs on the other hand rely more on tests. Like how are you ""manually"" going to test that some data objects coming through your kafka stream are processed correctly so they can be sent to the database? The whole premise just asks for some kind of programmatical test.\n\nWhile 100% code coverage can be good, it is not the ultimate milestone. You can have 100% code coverage but still you are not handling some cases correctly and have bugs in your code.', ""If you don't know any better, just do a unit test. At worst, it shows how to run the code, at best it finds issues.\n\nCode coverage is a fine metric, so yes, cover every edge case. I have had error handling that failed on runtime because printing the error failed in python. \n\nA thing I like to do is make asserts or early returns specifically to break tests if my assumptions about the world has changed going into the function.\n\nOnce you have real world data (reported bugs by users) you need to add additional tests to make sure those cases are covered as well.""]"
1oj59uk,Should you not do courses and directly develop/implement?,"I recently talked to a relative who just completed his degree from a prestigious college and landed his first job through campus placement. I told him that I'll complete my undergraduate in one year (I'm in a tier 4 college) and that I'm currently doing a web developement course, and will do a DSA course when I'm done. 

This is the essence of what he said:

""Courses are useless. You'll be stuck in an endless hell and waste your time. Instead, directly start developing and learn what you need on the way.

For example, instead of doing a web developement course, decide on building some website, then ask ChatGPT how to do it. ChatGPT is the best learning resource right now. Note down the steps and watch YouTube videos to learn just what's required for the development of the website, for each step. Keep developing and you'll learn along the way. 

Similarly, instead of doing a DSA course, just start solving LeetCode and learn as you do. You can look for explanatory videos for specific problems along the way.""

I find that to be an interesting perspective. I would like to know what others think about it.
 
I've completed about 40% of the course and it's a long one. Should I give it a stop?

I’ve been learning programming for almost 2 months now, and honestly… I feel really lost.

I use AI sometimes to help me understand or write code, and while I *do* understand everything at first, after some time it’s like my brain just forgets it all.

1ojc4as,Is there any benefits to limiting the recourses you learn from?,"So I asked myself this question when I first watched a podcast with John Carmack. He was explaining how he learned programming from the very small selection of books his library offered, but mostly from NEWSPAPER CUTOUTS. On top of that he was programming games in assembly!

When it comes to problem sets, I find that I learn best without the help of ai. But I ask this question in regards to googling as well because this is something I'm very indecisive about. I'll give an example, the other day I was working on a CS50 problem set and I ended up spending too much time trying to make over complicated for loops to compare each char in an array of strings. Then, when I finally googled it, I found out there was a function in a library that did it for me. Maybe this isn't the best anecdote because I could've read the documentation on the library before hand, but I hope you get my point. I also think ai is so much more looked down upon than googling, but I think both can reinforce the same bad habits, I.e when things get difficult you end up relying on something else. 

I understand that it wasn't the limited resources that made John Carmack into John Carmack. However, I personally think a scarcity in resources indirectly makes you remember things better. ""Why would I need to remember the syntax differences in declaring a function in JS vs Python if the answers are a couple clicks away."" 

I'm genuinely curious to hear what your opinions are on this. What would be ways to balance this? Could the complete opposite of googling everything be beneficial, i.e only picking a handful of resources and limiting yourself to that?

1ojg0gi,How do you learn to analyze the design of code in tutorials/learn to implement ideas from scratch?,"in concept art, there is a term called 'kitbashing' where people use assets to make a collage to build their project off of, whether it is using a 3d render to paint over for a 2d illustration or using kits of generalized parts such as screws or technical looking parts of machinery.

This is likely a stupid analogy, but I have viewed this to be similar to using tutorials. So far, when I am designing a program from scratch, I make a diagram where I roughly describe and draw out features, then I try to write down potential places I could find an example of the feature. usually it starts with generally describing the feature in google ""How to draw a line between two objects in godot"" for example, then I start looking up classes in the godot library I can use and watching tutorials of feature implementation that is somewhat similar.

But I often get stuck trying to then understand the code in the tutorial and studying whether the method used in the tutorial is the most efficient way for my project, or if I cannot find a tutorial that is directly relevant I struggle to try and take apart the code line by line in the documentation.

But as a programming beginner, I also don't really understand the design of a library. I may roughly understand the description of a function such as vector2 get\_point\_position(index:int) for example returning the position of a point, but I  may not understand the underlying design, such as how I still don't understand how a vector can have an index, or whether it's the 2d line itself  that is an array containing points.

  
Initially I thought there was some holy grail book of software architecture & programming library design that if I read, I would have a rough idea of how to outline the implementation of any project, I wouldn't awkwardly type in a rough description of my feature into google but I would rather have a label for the type of data structure and algorithm the feature uses and knew exactly where to look in the library documentation, or if developing from complete scratch.

I've went through CS50, reviewed the programming fundamentals of addresses, pointers, OOP principles, intermediate programming in java implementing binary searches and linked lists etc, but my implementation skills still really suck, even after making a design diagram and pseudocode, I never know where to look in order to translate my pseudocode into a specific function in a library or a class from scratch. It feels like I am somewhat a native speaker in 'design', but I barely know my alphabet in terms of implementation.

Deal with optimizations when you need to, or when you feel like it. Get it running and working first. \n\n> or if I cannot find a tutorial that is directly relevant I struggle to try and take apart the code line by line in the documentation. \n\nThat\'s okay! It\'s a skill you develop with time. The way I approach this is, ""how does what I want to do differ from the tutorial?"" and most of the time I can kinda figure out a way to progress from tutorial to what I desire. \n\n>  I still don\'t understand how a vector can have an index, or whether it\'s the 2d line itself that is an array containing points. \n\nIt is always interesting to learn how a library works, but it\'s not _always_ necessary. Going back to your art example, I might know how to use a paint brush, I might know how to mix two paint colors together to get something new, but I might not know how a brush is made from scratch or what the individual pigments that go into a paint color are. Sometimes it helps, maybe one pigment reacts differently in certain conditions, and not knowing that might catch you off guard. But, it\'s not _required_ knowledge, most of the time. \n\n\nGood luck, hang in there. I remember feeling this way too, but I can\'t pinpoint a singular thing that got me over it. I think it was just stubbornness? I tend to go ""fuck it, IDC if it exists or if it\'s slow, I just wanna make the thing and see it work"". Slowly but surely, you start picking up new skills. At times they feel distinct and disjointed, but sooner than later they\'ll click. Another thing try is to view your initial idea document as just a guideline. You _think_ you\'ll use a linkedlist here, recursion there, etc etc. But when it comes to actually implementing it, you might find that your initial assumptions about the project were not accurate, and you\'ll have to adapt.']"

The code compiles and run as intended on an online Swift compiler, so I'm not sure what went wrong. Did I adopt some bad coding practice that tricked Xcode into thinking my `printSummary()` method wasn't used? Is this a playgrounds problem? I'm asking as I don't want to continue some bad coding practice and have it affect my code down the line when I'm actually writing an app.

These are just handy, recognisable, expressive constructs for us humans. Don\'t get too hung up on the suggestions above for which to use when. It often doesn\'t matter (e.g. for and while are both used for traversing arrays often).', ""`while` is your basic loop, the thing keeps repeating while the condition is true\n\n`do {} while` is the same as while, but the condition is checked at the end of the loop. I've used it once or twice\n\n`for` is just like while but there's some shorthand built in. in the () you have some ;. it goes like `(setup; condition; increment)`. setup runs once, before we start looping, the condition is just the same as the condition from `while`, and then the increment runs at the end of each loop, right before we repeat"", 'All loops, For, while and do while basically do the same: They are control flow statements that repeat their body , depending on the condition specified. \n\nIn a for loop, the condition is very specific: \n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\n        printf(""%d"", i);\n\n`int i = 0` is executed once, when the loop is entered. It is called the initialization. In this case you specify the variable i to be an integer and initialize it to 0.\n\n`i < 3` is the condition. It is executed before every loop and exits the loop if it returns false. In this case you repeat until i reaches 3, and then stop.\n\n`++i` is the step, and is executed between two executions of the loop to set up the next. In this case you increase i by one for the next loop. \n\nThis loop will print 0, 1 and 2. \n\nIn a while loop you just put a condition down, and the loop is executed until that condition is false (not unlike the middle statement in an if loop)\n\n    int i = 0;\n    while (i < 3) {\n      printf(""%d"", i);\n      ++i;\n    }\n\nThis would do exactly the same as the foor loop above. \n\nA do while loop is similar, but the check is performed after each loop, not before. This means a do while loop always executes at least once. \n\n    int i = 0;\n    do {\n      printf(""%d"", i);\n      ++i;\n    } while (i < 3);\n\nAll of these will do exactly the same thing in this case. You can basically write any loop you want to write in any of the three styles, it just depends what is more readable and thus most appropriate in any given situation. \n\nA nested loop is just a loop, inside another loop, like: \n\n    while (condition) {\n      while (condition2) {\n        do_stuff();\n       }\n    }', ""This is the kind of thing LLM's give great answers for."", 'Simply put (for any language): The FOR loop will ALWAYS execute N-times. The DO loop will start executing and at each iteration end will check ""should i stop here""? So it will execute at least ONE time. The WHILE loop might NOT execute at all if the condition is not met. But if met it will start executing and at the beginning of each time will ask ""should i stop here""? That\'s it. Nested loop simply means that inside each loop you can have another loop (and many other loops).\n\nThe most simple thing to illustrate a nested loop is to traverse a matrix. A matrix is simply a 2D-array, which means a nested array, which means simply an array who\'se elements are also arrays.\n\n    //Imagine this: \n    ARR = [\n      [1,2,3],\n      [4,5,6],\n    ]\n\nSo to traverse this we will do (this is NOT real code, i am just illustrating):\n\n    for (x = 0; x < length(ARR); i++):  // this will run accross the main array\n      for (y = 0; y < length(ARR[x]); y++):  / this will run on each of the sub-arrays\n        # do something here']"
1oj45bs,Can you take a second to evaluate my use of AI.,"Good morning,

So for context  I work solo as a platform engineer  in a manufacturing facility. I make data pipelines and web pages inside of a monorepo.

I never went to college. I have been interested in programming since i was 15 I am just turned 26. I have always been around programming but never was successful back in 2015 days. hard to find context specific details of work.

fast forward today I start making reports for one of the managers from our oracle ERP database and got moved to where i am at.

I am heavily involved in programming culture. I spend time listening to Casey Muratori, Jblow, Mitchell Hashimoto, Prime, Theo, Rich Hickey, BigBoxSwe I spend countless hours trying to learn via video to help shape opinions and design philosophy passively .

Enough background and Context.

When I use AI its to solve something like this.

""In golang i want to move to a directory and execute a cli command and get the std in and out and report back. what does golang give you to do this?""

""Can you look through my code base and scan for any errors they i may have missed or places i could have been more performant or idiomatic and explain why with links""

""does this design pattern make sense here?""

""insert error message because why are stack traces so cryptic""

""Code Review this""

""I have a idea to build this and wanted feedback what do you think""

most  of my question pertain to seeing how something is done in isolation rather then trying to have it auto generate code for me.

because im solo i try to reduce api finding as much as possible and i try to use that time to understand the docs of what pertains.

I have guilt and imposter syndrome do to being isolated and AI being the only thing i can talk to.

I wanna make sure im not cooking myself.

I am genuinely wanting to improve and look forward to your feedback.

I love being programmer and want to do the best I can to be competent so don't go easy on me :)

This can be an issue in the long run.\n\nSecond, your AI workflow looks lightweight. You should use coding oriented tools like Claude Code or OpenAI Codex, which have built in planning, context and code review tools. Your employer might limit access to these though.""]"

Debugging is a critical skill in software development and is one of the main skills that I feel differentiates a bad or ok programmer with a really good programmer."", 'I would avoid using AI for learning atm.\n\nIt\'s a good tool for learning path planning for well-known topics. But if you\'re looking to build the right mental models of concepts in your brain, doing things manually like coding by hand is a good check on your understanding. We\'re discovering all the benefits of hand-coding that we\'ve taken for granted before.\n\nStudents and junior engs I work with learn much slower with AI. It ""feels"" faster because they\'re producing more code, which used to be a good metric in manual coding days where all the code were produced by humans. But with AI tools, people with the wrong/fuzzy mental model can produce a lot of correct code. The feedback loop is kinda broken, and I fear many learners are shooting themselves in the foot with too much AI assistance.']"

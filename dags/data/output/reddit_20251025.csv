1ofcado,Should github even be used for personal projects?,"If I'm working on a project for personal use (such as working through a tutorial or learning exercise), should I be using github at all, or just relying on a local git repository?

1of4o57,Debugging story that made me look stupid,"I recently created a repository, a complete beginner’s guide on open source contribution, and made it open for contributions. One day, a user opened a pull request adding a new MDX document about setting up the development environment. There were no build errors, no merge conflicts, everything looked fine, so I reviewed it and merged the PR.

The app is hosted on Vercel, the build went perfectly, no errors at all. But when I checked the website, the new document was not showing. At first, I thought it was just caching, so I refreshed the page, but nothing happened. Then I tried a hard refresh, still nothing. I even cleared cookies and cache manually, but still no result. I gave up for the day.

The next day I checked Vercel to see if I had missed something, but the deployment looked fine. I even redeployed the last commit, but the new doc was still not showing. I opened the editor, ran git fetch and pull, started the dev server, and the docs were still not showing there either. I spent the whole day reading through Fumadocs and Next.js documentation, thinking I must have forgotten some step, but I found nothing. Frustrated, I gave up and went to sleep.

At midnight, just before falling asleep, my brain suddenly remembered something. In the docs folder there is a meta.json file that maps all the docs. I had completely forgotten to add the new doc there. The next morning, I updated meta.json and, of course, it started showing perfectly.

1oflqd0,Difficulty focusing on one language.,"Over the last few years, I’ve been teaching myself programming. I’m currently 32 and I wouldn’t say I’m “good” at any specific language. During these past few years, I’ve always jumped between multiple languages (C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, etc). I have basic knowledge in the languages listed, but I wouldn’t say enough to build something worth while.

I do try and stick to one language, but then I’d usually get bored, see a new shiny thing, and jump towards that. Then most of the time, I’ll do a complete 360 and return to the language I initially started with. I’ve been doing this for years and always struggled just to stick to 1 language. And it feels like I’ve shot myself in the foot by not specialising in a single language to become efficient in it. 

I think the reason why I struggle focusing on a single language, is (in my honest opinion) ADHD. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with it, but a few friends who have it, have said it’s a common thing to hyper focus on something, then jump to something else (they work in tech themselves). And the other reason, is that I do find all languages interesting and want to learn as much as possible (which I know isn’t ideal when starting out).

I do believe that my interests change quite a lot too, which is most likely another factor. Whether that’ll be attempting to make a small game, website, desktop app, etc. I’ve found it hard just to pick one language and run with it, ignoring the rest until I’ve built up good knowledge of different algorithms, data structures, design patterns etc.

As an example, my current job, they use C#/.NET for the backend services, and now my brain wants to learn C# again. But then I’m telling myself, “what’s the point, as you’d only focus on it for a few weeks/months, then your focus will change when a new shiny thing is discovered, or you get bored.”

Has anyone else done the same in the past? If so, how did you combat it? Any advice would be appreciated.",7,10,DesperateOriginal827,learnprogramming,4260106,2025-10-25 07:48:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oflqd0/difficulty_focusing_on_one_language/,False,False,False,False,0,"[""don't commit to C# *forever*; commit to C# for one specific project with a tangible outcome.

1ofcuth,Learn Express.js or something else?,"Hi there.. aspiring SWE here.

I been doing JavaScript for a while now and I kinda soaked myself into React for quite some time now..

I want definitely to enter the world of backend (moreover I want to be BE eng. I just wanted to start from FE.) and easiest way now seem something like Express.js

Now I have my doubts, my friend is saying how amazing of a framework that is, while I'm reading on internet how bad and how outdated it actually is .. and how future of express is uncertain.

So yeah I don't know what to do now. Should close my eyes and ears and go all in Express.. or should I try Nest, Hono or maybe even leave node/js and try something like Laravel, Go or .Net...

And one more thing is Node viable for good backend development or is it more of a specialty/niche thing.

For anything you are going to build (at least to start out with), the performance will be acceptable. Just use what you feel comfortable with. If you don't know any framework yet, just take the one with the biggest userbase / selection of tutorials. That will make your start easier, and switching a framework later really is not that hard. \n\nIt's just like learning your first programming language feels hard, because you are actually learning programming. Once you pick up your second language, it will go pretty fast, and your third language won't even take an entire weekend to start getting productive. Same goes for frameworks: Once you know how a backend is structured, they are all pretty much the same.

I say in your area because it does drastically change depending on when you live! JavaScript is often miserable for employment, especially if you are BE only.\n\n\\- If your goal is to learn some stuff, I would stay with JS/Express. You are already familiar with JS, so you can learn the server-side concepts more easily without having to relearn the language. But learning comes in any shape, so it would also be perfectly fine to switch to a different language if you want to.\n\n\\- If your goal is to become a full-stack dev with a decent developer experience, definitely stay in the JS ecosystem.

1ofmi5n,Learning to code in university,"Lately, I’ve been realizing something about my journey in university — especially now that I’m in my second year. I’m not struggling with the subjects themselves. I’m struggling with caring about them the way the system expects me to.

Every time exams approach, I don’t feel scared, anxious, or even motivated. I just feel… detached. Because my goal isn’t to chase marks — it’s to understand, to learn, to build. What excites me isn’t memorizing for a grade, it’s learning cutting, learning something that actually connects with my future.

But the problem is that sometimes, the environment around you drains you before you even start. You see people studying hard to get top marks, while you’re there trying your best to understand — but there’s nothing to truly understand. You try to find meaning in what you study, but most teachers themselves aren’t motivated, and it kills your spark a little every day.

Living in Algeria doesn’t make it easier — the system feels heavy, exhausting, and uninspiring. You go to university, follow the hours, come back home drained, and even on your “rest days,” you don’t really rest. You just survive.

And sometimes I ask myself: do students in other countries feel the same? Are they also fighting to keep their curiosity alive in a system that wants to turn everyone into the same mold?

I’m not saying I hate studying. I actually love learning. I just wish learning wasn’t reduced to chasing numbers on a piece of paper.

So yeah, I’m excited to cut — to start my own path, to learn differently, to build something that feels alive.

You are not at the point where they will work for you.\n\nStart with simple programs, short, small, simple.

This is exactly the reason you\'re not really improving. **You** need to learn to develop these and this can\'t be done if you already have the pseudo-code. \n\nThe *implementation* in a programming language is the lesser evil. It\'s just a more or less mechanical task.\n\nComing up with the *algorithm* is the bigger, more important task.\n\nThere are several books commonly recommended:\n\n+ ""Think Like A Programmer"" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ ""The Pragmatic Programmer"" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ ""Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ ""Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software"" by Charles Petzold\n\nAnd finally, I\'ll leave some of my comments to previous, similar posts, as this is a very frequently discussed topic:\n\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9ezmx/getting_better_at_coding/mhdna2e/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1iz7wv3/how_to_become_a_better_engineer/mf10qbg/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j3w7x9/how_to_actually_learn_problem_solving_skills/mg3q9ya/\n+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ioehwa/struggling_to_put_together_my_own_code/mcirhxq/\n+ https://redd.it/1jyd36k', 'Before answering, I am going to turn it around on you - when you say: *""I am not a very logic person, in fact I am very artistic""* I imagine that you like to paint, create paintings, perhaps of nature and cats, perhaps of imaginary ideas. No matter ... We\'ll just pretend that you are a skilled painter.\n\nNow imagine that someone comes up to you, saying: ""How to I get better at drawing? I\'m not very artistic, but I like to think very logical, and my goal in drawing is to simply be able to make these drawings I see street-artists do, where a few simple lines suddenly resemble a duck or an elephant! I want to try those challenges and overtime get better at it!""\n\nHow would you react, what would you tell them? I\'d imagine that you\'d get somewhat angry, tellin them that isn\'t what drawing is about, that is just learning some basic shapes and strokes, and repeating them over and over again, following a pattern like a robot! No, if they want to learn drawing, they should start by watching the world around them, note how light and shadows move, make sketches, thousands of sketches, practice, imagine, dream and practice over and over, not trying to copy those ""hack artists!""\n\nBecause that is what leetcode and the rest is - it isn\'t about programming, it is about knowing and memorizing patterns for solutions to specific problems. There isn\'t even any problem solving involved - surely, you might be able to ""invent"" an algorithm that solves that particular problem, but that isn\'t what most people do, they just know of the correct algorithm to apply. And the only way of knowing, it to have been exposed to a large number of algorithms, and remembering (or being good at looking them up). Something an AI like ChatGPT is extremely good at - but still, it isn\'t really programming, just like drawing a ""remembered shape"" isn\'t really drawing.\n\n  \nIf that is still your goal, then you simply need to learn all the algorithms and remember them - it is boring stuff, and absolutely useless, but it can be done, and is done by a lot of over-eager students around the world. Just go through every article in this list: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Data\\_structures\\_and\\_algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Data_structures_and_algorithms) \\- read and implement every one - then you\'ll quickly see that most leetcode problems is similar to one of those.\n\nIf however you would like to learn to program, and actually solve real problems, then look at your program like you would look at creating a piece of art. Imagine the finished piece in your mind, begin with the rough sketches, implement some ideas, research parts you need to know more about, and gradually work your way towards the goal. That is what programming is supposed to be - not guessing at which algorithm some writer were thinking of when they designed the problem!']"

now onto technicals: the code I already have:  
done in lua,  
a and b will be tables containing the following values: OID (a string, either ""circ"" for circle or ""sqar"" for rectangles), x, y (the top left of the rectangle or center of the circle), if it's a circle it'll have the 'size' key, indicating it's radius, if it's a circle it'll have the xl and yl keys, indicating the length in pixels from it's (x,y) in the top left, to it's (x,y) in the bottom right.  
vec.make(x,y) returns a vector which has an attatched metatable, the exact contents of the metatable aren't especially important, just know that I can add/do operations on vectors easier (\_\_add, \_\_sub etc), there's also :sqar() which returns a vector with the x and y squared.

Currently, I have code for the 3 possible cases (square x circle, circle x circle and square x square), though it's not debugged so there's likely to be issues scattered through.

1of7gvl,Help at roadmapping,"Hello, I’m 18 yo, living in London. I just moved here on 1st Oct 2025. I’m trying to figure out what to do next, basically interested in programming roadmap. I know only basic programming, and I started learning Golang on my own, but not for long. I guess I prefer backend, but I’m open to suggestions if you think another path is better :D

I’m wondering about the fastest way to reach a junior developer level.
	•	Is it realistic to get to a decent level in 1–2 years of self-learning and small projects?
	•	Or would it be better to go to university and get a degree first, then start looking for work?
	•	Maybe it’s possible to start working on projects / internships while studying at university, so I wouldn’t waste time?

About studying / learning options:
	•	Are universities really worth it for getting a job, considering 3+ years of tuition and living costs?
	•	Would 1-year courses or bootcamps be a faster and efficient alternative?
	•	How realistic is it to find a job without a diploma, only with self-made projects and GitHub portfolio?

Other context:
	•	I plan to work part-time in hospitality or similar while learning.
	•	I want realistic advice on how to balance learning, earning, and building portfolio.

Here is the link to the documentation:  
[https://liquid-charts.gitbook.io/liquid-charts-api-docs](https://liquid-charts.gitbook.io/liquid-charts-api-docs)

According to this, I need to make a POST request with the following JSON:

    {
        ""username"": ""username of the client"",
        ""domain"": ""domain of the client"",
        ""password"": ""password of the client""

I'm using my email for my username and password for password, but I can't figure out what they want for domain. I've tried... a lot of stuff. email domain (with full email as username, and also just the part before the @ as username). I've tried all the domains I can find or think of for liquid brokers (api.liquidcharts.com, pro.liquidcharts.com, liquidbrokers.com, a few other things, and variations of all of them with/without the '.com' or the 'pro.' parts. Every time I get a 401 Authorization Error 3 (incorrect credentials). Another detail, I get a different error if I mess with the keys of the JSON, so I know I'm successfully hitting their server and attempting the login. 

I've reached out to their customer service and they've confirmed my account is authorized to access the API, but they refuse to give me any hints as to what they're expecting for the domain argument.

Any assistance would be very much appreciated. I would offer a reward, but it's not allowed :p

That's what will send the code to github basically. You will have a local repository you will add files you want to commit (save) and then push (upload) to your github repo.\n\nThe simplest way in my opinion is to make the repo on github and then clone it on your pc. There's a link at the code button on each repo that has a link you will select the link http or ssh. Ssh will have to be set up, but you can do http for now.

Be careful to push only to that. Big projects that are open source or whatever probably have their own rules and stuff on how to commit. Don't make a pull request before you are sure you want to send your changes to the original repo. \n\nTo push in a project that there are other people, you must make a branch and commit there and not push to the main branch. Do it when you are more comfortable with github. \n\nSpeaking from experience, if more than one person worms in the same branch and files, it's a nightmare to fix bc there are conflicts all the time. So what people do is they do stuff in separate branches and deal with that later.\n\nEdit: look up the Odin Project or how to set up repo b4 you do anything bc you will have to set up git so that your name shows on commits"", 'Have an account , start a repo and do basic add , push , commit , pull , fork etc...\n\nThen we talk about contributing to other projects']"

1off6zb,JavaScript's `Array.sort()` converts everything to strings by default!,"```javascript
[1, 5, 10, 25, 100].sort()
// Returns: [1, 10, 100, 25, 5]
```

Why? Because `sort()` converts elements to strings and compares them lexicographically (alphabetically). So ""10"" comes before ""5"" just like ""apple"" comes before ""banana""!

To sort numbers correctly, you need a compare function:

```javascript
[1, 5, 10, 25, 100].sort((a, b) => a - b)
// Returns: [1, 5, 10, 25, 100]
```

**How it works:**
- If `a - b` is negative → `a` comes first
- If `a - b` is positive → `b` comes first  
- If `a - b` is zero → order unchanged

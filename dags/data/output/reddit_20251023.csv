1odfg0o,dbt-core fork: OpenDBT is here to enable community,"Hey all,

Recently there is increased concerns about the future of the dbt-core. To be honest regardless of the the fivetran acquisition, dbt-core never got any improvement over time. And it always neglected community contributions. 

[OpenDBT](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt) fork is created to solve this problem. Enabling community to extend dbt to their own needs and evolve opensource version and make it feature rich.

[OpenDBT](https://github.com/memiiso/opendbt) dynamically extends dbt-core. It's already adding significant features that aren't in the dbt-core. This is a path toward a complete community-driven fork.

We are inviting developers and the wider data community to collaborate. 

Please check out the features we've already added, star the repo, and feel free to submit a PR!

1od2x2k,Parquet vs. Open Table Formats: Worth the Metadata Overhead?,"I recently ran into all sorts of pain working directly with raw Parquet files for an analytics project  broken schemas, partial writes, and painfully slow scans.   
That experience made me realize something simple: Parquet is *just* a storage format. It’s great at compression and column pruning, but that’s where it ends. No ACID guarantees, no safe schema evolution, no time travel, and a whole lot of chaos when multiple jobs touch the same data.

Then I explored open table formats like Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi  and it was like adding a missing layer of order on top  impressive is what they are bringing in 

* ACID transaction**s** through atomic metadata commits
* Schema evolution without having to rewrite everything
* for easy rollbacks and historical analysis we have Time travel 
* you can scan millions of files in milliseconds by Manifest indexing another cool thing 
* not to forget the hidden partitions 

In practice, these features made a *huge* difference  reliable BI queries running on the same data as streaming ETL jobs, painless GDPR-style deletes, and background compaction that keeps things tidy.

But it does make you think  is that extra metadata layer really worth the added complexity?  
 Or can clever workarounds and tooling keep raw Parquet setups running just fine at scale?

1od40jc,PSA: Coordinated astroturfing campaign using LLM–driven bots to promote or manipulate SEO and public perception of several software vendors,"Patterns of possible automated bot activity promoting several vendors across r/dataengineering and broader Reddit have been detected.

Easy way to find dozens of bot accounts:  Find one shilling a bunch of tools then search these tools together.

Here's an [example query](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=airbyte+dreamfactory&type=comments&sort=new) or[ this one](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=airbyte+windsor&type=comments&sort=new) which find **dozens of bot users and hundreds of comments**. When pasting these comments to an LLM it will immediately identify patterns and highlight which vendors are being shilled with what tactic.

Community: **stay alert and report suspected bots. Tell your vendor if on the list that their tactics are backfiring.** When buying, consider vendor ethics, not just product features.

# Consequences exist! All it takes some pissed off reports.

Luckily astroturfing is illegal in all of the countries where these vendors are based.[ ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-25/operation-clean-turf-and-the-war-on-fake-yelp-reviews)

[Here's what happened in 2013 to vendors with deceptive practise in sting operation ""clean turf"".](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-25/operation-clean-turf-and-the-war-on-fake-yelp-reviews) Founders and their CEOS were publicly named and shamed in major news outlets, like The Guardian, for personally orchestrating the fraud. Individuals were personally fined and forced to sign legally binding ""assurance of discontinuance"", in some cases prohibiting them from starting companies again.

For the 19 companies, the founders/owners were forced to personally pay fines ranging from $2,500 to just under $100,000 and sign an ""Assurance of Discontinuance,"" legally binding them to stop astroturfing.

# Reddit context

A [Reddit ban on AI bot research](https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1kczxvw/reddit_bans_researchers_who_used_ai_bots_to/) shows how seriously this is taken.

1od6qy5,How much time are we actually losing provisioning non-prod data,"Had a situation last week where PII leaked into our analytics sandbox because manual masking missed a few fields. Took half a day to track down which tables were affected and get it sorted. Not the first time either. 

Got me thinking about how much time actually goes into just getting clean, compliant data into non-prod environments. 

Every other thread here mentions dealing with inconsistent schemas, manual masking workflows, or data refreshes that break dev environments. 

For those managing dev, staging, or analytics environments, how much of your week goes to this stuff vs actual engineering work? And has this got worse with AI projects? 

Feels like legacy data issues that teams ignored for years are suddenly critical because AI needs properly structured, clean data. 

Curious what your reality looks like. Are you automating this or still doing manual processes?",19,19,EstablishmentBasic43,404407,2025-10-22 12:22:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1od6qy5/how_much_time_are_we_actually_losing_provisioning/,0,False,False,False,False
1odains,Ducklake on AWS,"Just finished a working version of a dockerized dataplatform using Ducklake! My friend has a startup and they had a need to display some data so I offered him that I could build something for them.

The idea was to use Superset, since that's what one of their analysts has used before. Superset seems to also have at least some kind of support for Ducklake, so I wanted to try that as well.

So I set up an EC2 where I pull a git repo and then spin up few docker compose services. First service is postgres that acts as a metadata for both Superset and Ducklake. Then Superset service spins up nginx and gunicorn that run the BI layer.

Actual ETL can be done anywhere on the EC2 (or Lambdas if you will) but basically I'm just pulling data from open source API's, doing a bit of transformation and then pushing the data to Ducklake. Storage is S3 and Ducklake handles the parquet files there.

Superset has access to the Ducklake metadata DB and therefore is able to access the data on S3.

To my surprise, this is working quite nicely. The only issue seems to be how Superset displays the schema of the Ducklake, as it shows all the secrets of the connection URI (:

I don't want to publish the git repo as it's not very polished, but I just wanted to maybe raise discussion if anyone else has tried something similar before?
This sure was refreshing and different than my day to day job with big data.

In these cases, 



1) what are the modern practices for creating analytics tools? As in libraries, workflows, or pipelines. For user-side tools, would Jupyter notebooks be applicable or should it be a fully baked app (whatever tech stack that entails)? I am concerned about hardcoding certain graphing functions too early (losing flexibility). What is common industry practice?



2) Is there a point in trying to get them to migrate over to PostGres or MySQL? My instinct is that I should just accept the xlsx file as input (maybe make suggestions on specific changes for the table format) but while I came in initially to help them automate and streamline, I feel I have more value add on the visualization front due to the heavily low-tech nature of the org.

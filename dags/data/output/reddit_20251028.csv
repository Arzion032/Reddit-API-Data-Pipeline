1ohrhs9,Tips for learning assembly as an experienced programmer?,"I'm an experienced programmer that always had assembly as a huge blind spot, but I'm looking at changing that. Not for any professional or project reason, just to sharpen my skills and have some fun learning something new. That said, I plan on dipping my toes into binary reverse engineering at some point.

Of course there are a trillion ways of approaching that, and my default mode here would be following some tutorial for a beginner level project, and maybe buying a book after that, if the motivation is still there. But before that I wanted to ask for some tips from people that already traveled this road.

* Do you know any particularly cool resource? Like some cool website in the vein of learnopengl.com, or some amazing book?
* Is there any type of project you'd recommend?
* Any other general tips?

1ohv7z8,Internship Troubles,"Hello!

I've been interning at a company for around 5 months now and I'm having a tough time honestly. I was hoping I could get some thoughts from people who've been where I have and pushed through it.

When I started, the company made it clear that they expected nothing from me, which I found a bit strange and it made me feel like my work didn't matter from the start. I was given my first project and I completed it in a month, I told my supervisor this and his reaction seemed more annoyed than pleased, and he said he would have to find something else for me to do if I don't slow down. He also explained that I had completed it much quicker than they expected (~3/4 months ahead of schedule). This made me feel great at the time; looking back, I fear they were just underestimating me.

I tried to take some initiative. I taught myself to write cleaner code, did some reading, tried to push the idea behind my first project further and add some extra features while I had no other projects or tasks lined up.

I eventually asked my supervisor for some more work and he put me onto doing bug fixes. I was happy at the time because it was helping me learn much more about the codebase, about the products they sell and I was making a difference, but 3 months later and there still wasn't any more projects lined up. I spoke to a couple of my friends also away on internships and they seem to be busy, with multiple projects waiting and with deadlines. It hurts even more when I see other members of staff working on projects I feel I would me more than capable of assisting them with and when I offer to help, they turn me away.

There have been monthly stand-ups where they joke about forgetting I'm there, I haven't had a single code review in the 5 months and when I ask management, they say they've been very busy. This makes me feel even more demoralized because if they're busy, why can't they get me to help?

Additionally, I just feel like I don't deserve to be there and like I'm expendable. My manager constantly jokes about how stupid people from my university are and I do try and laugh it off but it keeps making me feel even worse about being there. I even recall cases where they've been annoyed about me asking for help!

I've contemplated trying to leave in favour of another intenrship, but I don't think it's possible to find another at this time in the year and I can't imagine me leaving 8 months early would look good on my resume. I feel trapped and like I'm not improving at all.

Have any of you been in an internship like this?

I would appreciate all your thoughts and opinions on this as I'm really struggling.

1oi54ny,Drag & drop vs code for UI design,"Remember when you could design UIs by dragging controls with your mouse?Fast prototype etc...
Now everything seems to be code-based.

Do you prefer:
- **Visual design** (WYSIWYG, drag & drop)
- **Code-based** (writing UI in code/markup)

Why did the industry shift away from visual designers? Are there any modern tools that still offer great visual design experiences? Which approach leads to better maintainability?

Looking for perspectives from designers and developers.",4,6,sbhnP,learnprogramming,4260730,2025-10-28 09:52:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oi54ny/drag_drop_vs_code_for_ui_design/,False,False,False,False,0,"['Code-based won because it scales better for teams and version control. Drag and drop is faster for prototyping but becomes a mess in production. Honestly best workflow is hybrid, study what works on Screensdesign, mobbin or real apps first, rough prototype in figma if needed, then code it properly with a component library.  \n  \nVisual builders are fine for simple stuff but fall apart with complex interactions or when you need precise control. code gives you flexibility visual tools cant match.  \n  \nMaintainability goes to code hands down. trying to debug or modify drag and drop spaghetti is hell', ""I remember that. I like Qt Creator and Godot for letting me drag stuff around. But I do not like to work on other people's projects in those things.\n\nThere are a few fundamental tradeoffs here:\n\nThe code is the truth. Whatever the wysiwyg editor makes must translate to code. Whatever the code says must be presentable by the wysiwyg editor. This usually breaks down as soon as you do something with the code that the wysiwyg editor can not handle, like some custom widget for example. To make that work you have to write extra code just to make the wysiwyg editor compatible with your code again.\n\nOn the flip side a lot of the frontend code has structure that the wysiwyg editor can not show. DOM has a box model that doesn't allow you to simply drag/drop a button anywhere. The only way to do that is to position it with absolute. You wouldn't do that because it breaks responsiveness with different view-ports. Instead you would work with padding, margins, grid layouts etc to get the desired effect - but the wysiwyg cannot show that. It can only hint at that.\n\nThis in turn usually leads to people who're used only to the wysiwyg editor to forget about the underlying structure. There's plenty of precedent for that. LaTeX for example is about code representing structured text and styles to render headlines differently than normal text, Microsoft Word simply allows you to make text large and bold to emulate a heading. But the loss of structure also means you can't do the other stuff LaTeX can do like creating content listings and reducing page breaks immediately after headings. Designers who create mockups in Figma _can_ do really great work, or they can simply slap some shapes there and call it a day. But since the code will be the truth eventually, someone has to translate those shapes into the structure anyway.\n\nLastly, the people who work with code all day have a different problem than the people who rely mainly on wysiwyg editors. Graphical user interfaces are about discoverability of features and a quick preview of the final product. Material pipelines in Blender for example work very well as boxes connected with wires. \n\nCode has about information density, and is easier to work with. No graphical tool can fit as much information on a screen as well written text. Copy and pasting text works between tons of editors, but copy and pasting graphical elements only works in the same tool. You can check text into version control and get diffs or even move detection, that doesn't work for graphical elements unless it compiles to text first."", ""Visual design has the advantage of being easy on account of control.\n\nTextual design gives much greater control and can be made more efficient through, e.g. methods, functions, which leads to less repetitive and better maintainable code.\n\nIf you see the gibberish code that visual designers often produce, you will learn to value textual creation.\n\nVisual designers hardly ever optimized vs. textual design can heavily optimize.\n\nIf you need 10 similar elements, what is better? Dropping and manually sizing, aligning, etc. each individual element, or using a loop that places each element and directly adjusts the attributes? \n\nI've learnt to value textual GUI creation with Java Swing. Much faster, much easier, much cleaner code. I tried all IDEs with graphical GUI builders and the only one that produced half-way readable and maintainable code was Eclipse Window Builder pro. Both, Netbeans and IntelliJ produced unmaintainable code that broke on the faintest change.""]"

1oi0gn9,Epoll Proxy design questions,"Hi there,

This is my first time posting on this subreddit. If you think my question is better answered in other subreddits, please let me know.

So my last project was creating a [multi threaded web server in C](https://github.com/navrajkalsi/server-c).

Now for my next project, I want to take the next logical step and use **epoll**  and implement it to create a proxy in C. I have been researching and have started to code, but there is just so much to reason (at least for me) and think about with epoll when comparing to threads.

The proxy will **only deal with one host (upstream)**, so I do not need to call `getaddrinfo()` which blocks. I will be storing host info before `epoll_wait()`.

Today after scratching my head all day, I decided to create a diagram to help myself and ask if there are any mistakes in design and, more importantly, do I even understand epoll correctly?

Please look at the linked diagram and let me know if you see any mistakes and /or bad practices, or just suggestions to make it better.

One thing right of the bat, that I know will be tricky to implement, the timeout for keep-alive after response is sent to the client. Do you have any suggestions how to implement that?

Whenever `epoll_wait()` returns you remove all expired deadlines from the list and use the attached identifier to do your timeout action.']"
1ohr2bu,Will I be fine if I stick with Python to study topics like Design Patterns and Architecture?,"This is a question for devs with experience in multiple languages and projects.

I'm one of those infra/ops guys that came from the helpdesk. Whatever. I want to further my backend knowledge by studying design and architecture patterns.

I know such topics can be studied with Python, but do you actually recommend doing so? Some people say more ""enterprisey"" languages like Java/C# are a better fit for these subjects.

Sticking with Python seems like a no brainer: it would allow me to further my backend knowledge, maybe study Machine Learning basics for a potential move to MLOps... I don't know, maybe I'm just shooting myself in the foot unknowingly.

I'm reluctant to switch langauges because I also want to keep filling the gaps in my Computer Science knowledge with C.

Thank you, guys.",0,4,alcance_lexico,learnprogramming,4260730,2025-10-27 21:25:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ohr2bu/will_i_be_fine_if_i_stick_with_python_to_study/,False,False,False,False,0,"[""With Python knowledge, you're going to be fine to learn design patterns and architecture. \n\nPython only becomes an issue if there's something computationally challenging and is done in pure python. \n\nMost times, you're going to be writing Python, and the library will be optimized for its use case."", ""*Fellow beginner here*\n\n>I'm reluctant to switch langauges because I also want to keep filling the gaps in my Computer Science knowledge with C.\n\nDoes that mean you want to switch from C to Python, or continue learning C? \n\nWhatever your answer is, it seems obvious that you should stick with a single language and keep building with it. It's just a tool. \n\n  \nYou don't fret about using a hammer, mallet, or rock for learning the best design principles of building a house. You build the house (likely by learning from smaller projects first) and worry about upgrading your tools if your job becomes easier by doing so. You acquire the things you need as you come to realize you need them. Some people upgrade a lot, while others keep to old reliable. \n\nAs you build this house, or many smaller works in preparation for it, you'll start to see flaws in your approach and gaps in your understanding. You'll naturally want to learn more and correct them. That's the important part.\n\nThe tool you started with is not as significant as everything you've learned when building that house. Once you get good at building it, you'll be able to more easily acquire the workflow of other tools to build another house. When you start building other structures and specializing in your construction (assuming what you get into isn't already specialized), that's when the nature of your tools starts becoming more important. You \\*can\\* use a rock and a chisel, but a jackhammer would be easier... \n\nBy then you'll have already experimented with other tools, whether by necessity or boredom, and you won't worry too much about needing to switch them or learn a new one. \n\n  \n.\n\nYou'll see a lot of similarities between tools in how they approach design patters, and also see why one language has a preferred workflow while it appears nonexistent in another. If you're worried about not knowing enough about x language: as you learn how to work in Python, dig a layer deeper during concepts to get a better mental model of how things work.\n\nAs you dig those layers, you'll see how it's implementing certain design patterns of other languages using its own methods. \n\nDon't let your choice of tool keep you from learning what you actually want.\n\n  \n.\n\n  \nThat's how I see it, anyway."", 'I think its worth understanding a bit about why people say Java / C# for these subjects, and then you can decide for yourself.  Different languages expose different patterns, challenges, and ways of thinking as well as being different tools with strengths & weaknesses.  It\'s helpful to learn several, then keep using more than one.\n\nJava/C# are strongly, statically-typed languages (very much unlike Python).  Polymorphism, class hierarchies, etc, have to be planned ahead of time rather than some duck-typed ""does it fit?"".  This can be very powerful, but also quite limiting.  Many design patterns, especially the early ones, were developed to address those limitations.  Something like the Visitor pattern doesn\'t make much sense in Python but can be useful in C# (... maybe. Ok, bad example).  \n\nStatically-typed languages also make it easier to enforce architecture at compile time, which forces you to think about it more.  Abstract vs. concrete becomes especially important and you get ~~forced to deal~~ more opportunity to play with that.\n\nBut... the whole point of design patterns / architecture is that a lot of the principles translate between languages. Nothing wrong with starting in Python.  You\'ll spend a lot of time trying to learn how to get stuff done in a compiled language if you switch.  But also, you\'ll learn how to get stuff done with a compiled language.\n\nEither way, I\'d suggest trying to find some sort of learning material.  Online course, book, example, etc find something to learn from that works for you.  It\'s a big topic.', 'Build something.\n\nUse the language you are most familiar with (which seems to be Python). Don\'t go too nuts. Archetypical ""todo list"" type thing but maybe a little more original. Just think of something and put it together as best you can.\n\nThen, if you like, when you have done that, build the same thing in another language. You\'ll be surprised how much easier it is to do it like this, because then you are not ""learning C#"", which is something somebody might do for a lifetime, but instead you are ""figuring out how to do X thing in C#"", which is much easier and is basically the component step that you have to repeat to ""learn C#"" anyway.\n\nEverybody comes here like, ""How do I learn how to do back end coding?"".\n\nDo some of it.\n\nIf you like Python, build something in Python. A simple web app, or whatever. Have your simple thing include a bit of AI from somewhere and start your ""MLOps"" journey too.\n\nYou just have to do it. If you don\'t want to learn another language now, don\'t. Do it in what you know. At some point you\'ll want to see how it would look in something else. No rush.']"

But now I‚Äôm starting to think‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs something more to it. 

Before, there were no safety nets. If you didn‚Äôt do the work yourself, the task simply couldn‚Äôt be done. Now it feels more like a game: you can try a few times, and if it doesn‚Äôt work, no worries - AI will handle it.  
Lazy to search through documentation? Just ask gpt.

I'm building some projects and sometimes can use ai for it. Not just write code for me, tell me how to do smthg, but if i couldn't do something for a long time, I can ask it. And in the end.. it looks that I didn't get the idea of it (maybe in this case, you should just try to rewrite your code, okay)

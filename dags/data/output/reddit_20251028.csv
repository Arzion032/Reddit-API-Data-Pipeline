1oh2m07,💻 DSA vs Development — What actually matters more for a coder’s career?,"I’m on both sides — I practice DSA and work on development.
But honestly, I feel DSA is important only up to an intermediate level — enough to build problem-solving logic.

1ohdjcr,Full-Stack Web Development using Golang,"Hi r/learnprogramming

1ohla28,"How do you ""turn on"" HTTPS in an application? Basic Theory","This is what I understand. I kind of need some basic explanation to know where to look for things when I want to get deeper into this.

  
TCP and UDP are part of the **transport layer** in the tcp/ip stack and all layers up to that one are implemented by the **os kernel**. So my application won't have to implement it, it would use **system calls**.

For a web application a **client** and my **server** will communicate. The client will open a **tcp connection** with the correct **socket** ( ip : port 80 or 443 ) of my server. The client is e.g. the browser.

So now we have client and server with an open **tcp connection**.

  
**HTTP** is a protocol in the **application layer** in the tcp/ip stack so it has to be implemented by an application. In a nutshell, http is basically just a standard for how the string of text sent over the tcp connection is structured to be valid.

The **webserver** thats being communicated with is an application, so it implements the HTTP protocol. It can either serve static files or call programs or scripts and give the **request data** as a parameter. The application can then produce an answer. No matter if static or dynamic content is served, pretty much the webserver responds to the request it received



So that's my basic understanding at I think its correct. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here already.

TLS is also an application layer protocol, so it has to be implemented by an application. I heard of libraries like OpenSSL implementing them.

But where do I **turn on HTTPS** now? Since the server has to be able to serve static content or forward requests to an application or a script, I'd guess in the server? But what if my application doesn't directly run on that server and the request will be forwarded, the server would send the decrypted regular HTTP for the rest of the path to my application.",13,16,Few-Pressure-7331,learnprogramming,4260526,2025-10-27 17:48:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ohla28/how_do_you_turn_on_https_in_an_application_basic/,False,False,False,False,0,"['You\'ve basically got it. Everything up to TCP works the same. Above that, HTTP is a conversation that usually happens on TCP port 80, and HTTPS is a somewhat different conversation that usually happens on TCP port 443.\n\nThe important difference between the two is that to speak HTTPS, the server needs some sort of certificate that proves its identity. You can create a little temporary one for local testing, but if you want it to actually serve traffic on a domain name, it needs a real, trusted certificate. That certificate might be provided by whoever set up your domain, and often these days people use ""Let\'s Encrypt"" for this sort of thing. It provides little apps that can handle most of the work of getting and renewing certificates for you.', 'HTTPS is a separate protocol. It is TLS+HTTP, but it also has its own set of features.\n\nEither your server implements HTTPS and then maybe reuses some (most) HTTP logic when calling scripts or serving files. Or you use reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx, etc) that does certificate management and calls your server with HTTP requests.', '>But what if my application doesn\'t directly run on that server and the request will be forwarded, the server would send the decrypted regular HTTP for the rest of the path to my application.\n\nYou can look into the concepts of a ""reverse proxy"", which is basically a web server deployed by a service provider that takes web requests and forwards them to some other service. The forwarding can happen through HTTP calls, but in modern data centers you may also encounter request forwarding through other protocols that are more suited like gRPC. Reverse proxy servers can also handle load balancing, i.e. if the same application is deployed multiple times behind the reverse proxy the reverse proxy can choose the application with the lowest load as the forward target so that no server becomes overly burdened.\n\nReverse proxy servers can perform so called ""TLS termination"", where the reverse proxy handles the TLS handshake (and is aware of the TLS private keys that are used to prove service authenticity). This effectively strips the TLS functionality from the requests so that an application can focus purely on providing functionality, while the secure connection responsibility remains with the reverse proxy. However it is also possible (and encouraged) to encrypt a HTTP / gRPC connection that gets established within a data-center from the reverse proxy to the application server with TLS. You\'d do this if you don\'t trust the network infrastructure in the data center, e.g. because it runs a co-location server model where the server hardware owned by different entities is deployed within the same physical location.', 'Your http basics are sound. To run https on port 443, you need to run a service, which relies on a third-party SSL certificate. That certificate issuer is providing a guarantee of sorts that the server a client is going to connect to is actually the entity the client is expecting. Way back in the day, a variety of simple hacks made it easy to imitate a web site through dns poisoning/etc. SSL certificate and encrypting the data between client and server was a huge step in resolving that. \n\nWorth noting that SSL certificates can be self-issued and they are common for internal purposes (not Internet-facing). If you just want to run this as a test or something, you can create your own certificate and install it.', 'TLS just wraps the HTTP part before it hits TCP (or UDP if you use HTTP/3).\n\nThink of it as putting your http request in a box and locking it with a key before you send it by mail (TCP).\n\nYou turn on HTTPS by enabling the TLS settings your HTTP library exposes.']"
1ohedcg,What's a good option these days for kids to learn programming?,"I have a friend with a 9 year old and she was asking me for recommendations because her son wants to learn programming but *doesn't* want to do it using these ""block"" visual programming languages like Scratch or Snap.

Of course I'd recommend something like ""make a little game in Python"", but it occurred to me that even with help it might get frustrating and/or underwhelming.

When you were a kid, I\'m going to assume that you didn\'t have imposter syndrome or worry about other people playing with action figures better than you or building Lego sets better than you.

I've been discussing with my seniors too about the shortcomings of the system, about the bread and butter of the system like designing functions and the overall flow and structure of the program, any recommendations on books, materials to write code of better quality?

1ohv7z8,Internship Troubles,"Hello!

I've been interning at a company for around 5 months now and I'm having a tough time honestly. I was hoping I could get some thoughts from people who've been where I have and pushed through it.

When I started, the company made it clear that they expected nothing from me, which I found a bit strange and it made me feel like my work didn't matter from the start. I was given my first project and I completed it in a month, I told my supervisor this and his reaction seemed more annoyed than pleased, and he said he would have to find something else for me to do if I don't slow down. He also explained that I had completed it much quicker than they expected (~3/4 months ahead of schedule). This made me feel great at the time; looking back, I fear they were just underestimating me.

I tried to take some initiative. I taught myself to write cleaner code, did some reading, tried to push the idea behind my first project further and add some extra features while I had no other projects or tasks lined up.

I eventually asked my supervisor for some more work and he put me onto doing bug fixes. I was happy at the time because it was helping me learn much more about the codebase, about the products they sell and I was making a difference, but 3 months later and there still wasn't any more projects lined up. I spoke to a couple of my friends also away on internships and they seem to be busy, with multiple projects waiting and with deadlines. It hurts even more when I see other members of staff working on projects I feel I would me more than capable of assisting them with and when I offer to help, they turn me away.

There have been monthly stand-ups where they joke about forgetting I'm there, I haven't had a single code review in the 5 months and when I ask management, they say they've been very busy. This makes me feel even more demoralized because if they're busy, why can't they get me to help?

Additionally, I just feel like I don't deserve to be there and like I'm expendable. My manager constantly jokes about how stupid people from my university are and I do try and laugh it off but it keeps making me feel even worse about being there. I even recall cases where they've been annoyed about me asking for help!

I've contemplated trying to leave in favour of another intenrship, but I don't think it's possible to find another at this time in the year and I can't imagine me leaving 8 months early would look good on my resume. I feel trapped and like I'm not improving at all.

Have any of you been in an internship like this?

I would appreciate all your thoughts and opinions on this as I'm really struggling.

First readers–writers problem, requires that no reader be kept waiting unless a writer has already obtained permission to use the shared object. In other words, no reader should wait for other readers to finish simply because a writer is waiting.

And what I have understood from this is that if there is any reader running and a writer comes; then that writer would be blocked until reader has completed. But during the completion of first reader if there comes another reader (or multiple readers), then that (those) reader(s) will be given priority over writer.

if anyone can implement this problem in semaphore please give to me because i need it as soon as possible

1ohj32b,Can I use env variables in a GitHub Actions release.yml?,"Hey y’all. Currently I’m trying to get a small personal project set up. It’s pretty basic - Java/Spring Boot for now. I plan to add an Angular frontend and some other stuff too later on. 

So I’m working on getting my GitHub Actions set up right now. What I’m attempting is having a release.yml that pulls environment variables from a “secrets.env” file that’s in the root of my project. I want it to pull my docker user + pw from this file (as to not have to hard code anything into the release file). Then it’ll run, build an image, and push it automatically. From there I can connect the image to AWS EC2 & host it. That’s the plan anyways lmao. 

Is what I’m trying to do even possible? If so, do I *have* to use dotenv? I don’t really know what it is, so I was trying to avoid it if I can. It seems there’s a way to put the variables into GitHub actions itself, but I was hoping to make it easily readable & editable so that future changes/additions can be done in notepad or an IDE. 

I remember something similar to this being done at my last job, but I didn’t know how it  worked there either lol. Maybe it was strictly for local variables?? I’m also JUST NOW realizing while typing this out that my file stays completely local, so **duh** GitHub Actions doesn’t know what these variables are. XD

Maybe all of this makes no sense. Apologies if that’s the case. I hardly know anything about project setup, cloud, VMs, etc. in case it wasn’t obvious. Good ole GPT isn’t understanding my question properly either, so hopefully someone here can.

You can find various opinions online by googling things like ""best practices for writing PR summaries"" or ""best practices for writing git commits"".\n\nThat said, this is generally something people set conventions on a per-company or per-project basis. For example, some companies may closely follow some common best practices you can find via googling. Others eschew them and set a different internal standard like ""your PR summary should just be a link to a Jira ticket"" or whatever.\n\nA little more generally, I think you will find more rigorous standards related to topics such as security and managing user data, given any sort of breach/mishap at that layer can cause material financial and reputational impact. However, it\'s difficult to see how the way you write your PR summary could cause a security incident: at worst, a poor PR summary will add friction to the development process.

I am now starting to think seriously about a change in career and pursuing a job as a software engineer, although one problem I have is that I haven't identified an area I want to commit to yet (there's no lack of interest, I just have trouble choosing).

I have been mainly programming web-based applications using Java (Spring) and JavaScript, and am thinking that backend development seems like the best choice in terms of balancing the things I am interested in with industry demand. 

One thing that I have wanted to try learning is C++, mostly out of curiosity but I also want to try making my own computer vision related project, just something to learn the fundamentals, however I am wary that a lot of people say to focus on one thing until you are really good at it, and although I am competent with both languages I have been working with so far, I would still say I have a lot to learn. 

My questions are whether this might be spreading myself too thin at the moment,  or whether it would look fine on a resume to have projects in very different areas. Also, I am generally wondering what the demand for C++ software development is? I have seen a few jobs that ask for it, and they sound like genuinely interesting and exciting companies/roles, but I have a feeling it might be a pretty niche corner of the industry. 

Apologies if the questions seem naive, I am just recently coming to the decision that I want to pursue something which has been my hobby for a while, and I know the state of the industry is such at the moment that many people are struggling to find jobs, so I want to find the best way to use my time.

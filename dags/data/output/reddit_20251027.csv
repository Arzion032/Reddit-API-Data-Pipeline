1oh2m07,💻 DSA vs Development — What actually matters more for a coder’s career?,"I’m on both sides — I practice DSA and work on development.
But honestly, I feel DSA is important only up to an intermediate level — enough to build problem-solving logic.
After that, spending months on LeetCode just for patterns feels like overkill.

Once your fundamentals click, real-world development teaches you teamwork, architecture, and scalability — things DSA alone can’t.

What do you all think?
👉 Should beginners still grind DSA for months before touching dev?
Or balance both from day one?",29,15,shrinivas-2003,learnprogramming,4260470,2025-10-27 02:06:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oh2m07/dsa_vs_development_what_actually_matters_more_for/,False,False,False,False,0,"['Getting the job, DSA.

1ogwelb,I feel stuck,"I have basically memorized all the intro to <programming language> courses fully for java (since my school forces me to use java), C (because im personally interested in low level programming), C++ and C# (since its almost exactly the same as java), but the thing is i dont know where to go next.

Right now i have a school project where i have to build a quiz app in java swing, the problem is that they dont teach shit in class and i want to get beyond a C.

I guess its just really overwhelming to have something like java swing thrown at me to use when i dont know how it functions on a lower level. Like i get im supposed to make a jframe and add ui elements to it, but there's a disconnect happening between the coding concepts im learning and what im actually doing when building the app.

Also reading tons of documentation is very time consuming and migrane inducing. In the past ive built a very simple 3d simulation using opengl in C++ and while i did get praised a lot like i was some genuis by my proffessor, i dont even fully understand the rendering pipeline or what each and every function call i made does.

Basically what im trying to say is: i fully understand the building blocks (ifs, loops, variables, functions, OOP concepts...) but i cant actually connect that to what im doing when making an app that actually does something.

Also when i have an idea for an program i wanna make, i find it really hard to break it down into managable subproblems and get overwhelmed.

I'm a 30 year old who has always wanted to learn a bit of programming on the side.  Here and there I've sat down for a week or two and worked through some beginner python resources, but I've always struggled to stick with the learning process.

Based on the advice I've seen, I think the biggest reason for this is that I've never been able to identify a particular project that I wanted to create.

Now, I think I have an idea that I isn't too complicated--but I'm hoping to get some feedback regarding whether or not it's feasible and whether Python is the best choice.

**Project Idea**

I would like to create a program that could constantly scan a given subreddit, determine whether or not a post meets certain criteria, and if it does, send me a push notification with a link to the post.

Fox example, I am a fan of the Boston Celtics.  So let's take r/bostonceltics as a potential example.

I would like to be able to tell me program to send me a notification if:

There is a new post on r/bostonceltics AND that post

\- Has the name ""Derek"" or ""Derek White"" in the title

\- Is a text post without a picture or link

\- Has 2 or fewer comments

\- Does not contain ""Brad"" or ""Brad Stevens"" in description.

I would of course also like to be able to change these parameters and have multiple queries at once.

  
To be clear, I don't want to create a bot to respond or create reddit spam--only be notified so I can then check out the post myself.



**1. Is this a feasible idea in scope for a beginner to work towards?**

**2. What are the likely roadblocks?**

**3. What is the best programming language?**

1ohesjj,Book/Material recommendations to improve coding skills,"
Hello devs,
I'm working as a java developer for about 2 years, and I'm part of a team of around 5-6 devs.  
  
The project is nearing the end, and although it's way above my current capabilities to have a concise judgement of the whole project, but I still feel like the code could have been written better.  
  
I've been discussing with my seniors too about the shortcomings of the system, about the bread and butter of the system like designing functions and the overall flow and structure of the program, any recommendations on books, materials to write code of better quality?
  
I've heard a lot about books such as ""clean code by Robert martin"" and ""code complete by Steve mcconnell""

1oh4lw8,Truck driver turned web dev enthusiast,"Hey everyone,

So here’s a bit of a random story... I’m a truck driver.. but recently I discovered that I might actually have a thing for web development. It all started when I was chatting with a friend who wanted a website for his small business... I told him that everything is online and that he can do it without paying an IT company...Then I thought, why not take the challenge myself? Which I did....

Long story short, I watched a YouTube tutorial, bought a domain + hosting, updated the name servers, installed WordPress, bought a ThemeForest theme, and used elementor to build him a site. Took me about a week..... He was mind-blown when I showed him the final result 🤣🤣
Just after that, something clicked.. I actually enjoyed doing all that. So I started learning HTML and CSS on freeCodeCamp, and honestly, I’m finding it fun and kind of addictive....

Now I’m wondering if I should take this seriously and maybe change careers down the road. But I need some guidance from people who’ve been there or know the field...

Should I go for frontend, backend, or full stack?

What’s the best way to learn and practice at the same time?

I am now starting to think seriously about a change in career and pursuing a job as a software engineer, although one problem I have is that I haven't identified an area I want to commit to yet (there's no lack of interest, I just have trouble choosing).

I have been mainly programming web-based applications using Java (Spring) and JavaScript, and am thinking that backend development seems like the best choice in terms of balancing the things I am interested in with industry demand. 

One thing that I have wanted to try learning is C++, mostly out of curiosity but I also want to try making my own computer vision related project, just something to learn the fundamentals, however I am wary that a lot of people say to focus on one thing until you are really good at it, and although I am competent with both languages I have been working with so far, I would still say I have a lot to learn. 

My questions are whether this might be spreading myself too thin at the moment,  or whether it would look fine on a resume to have projects in very different areas. Also, I am generally wondering what the demand for C++ software development is? I have seen a few jobs that ask for it, and they sound like genuinely interesting and exciting companies/roles, but I have a feeling it might be a pretty niche corner of the industry. 

Apologies if the questions seem naive, I am just recently coming to the decision that I want to pursue something which has been my hobby for a while, and I know the state of the industry is such at the moment that many people are struggling to find jobs, so I want to find the best way to use my time.

I fear going into this new position, like I might bomb on the first day.

Anyways, is it common to feel overwhelmed like this?? I'm pushing through, but just feel so uneducated.",0,3,uwu1004,learnprogramming,4260470,2025-10-26 23:31:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ogzc25/overwhelmed/,False,False,False,False,0,"['Building a full stack application by yourself is much different than programming as a job.\n\n\nAt your job you will have coworkers who you can ask questions of, and if it\'s a decent environment they\'ll be happy to help in your skill development and will have a knowledge base you can learn from.\n\n\nYour work will probably be a lot mor well defined and manageable than ""figure out how to build a full stack app""', ""Before you start, refresh your programming memory by going over the code you have written. \n\nTake a small paper notebook and pen with you on your first day.

1oguviq,"What's Your routine, and how do you manage so many resources?","* If this topic is too similar to others, please let me know.

After being a procrastinator, like many of us, I took courage and started studying python. It bugs me, though, that there are so many resources available today that I don't know what to keep.

And mostly, I'm not used to setting up a daily routine for studying: while doing well with structure in high school, structuring on my own feels hard and ""groundless"".

So I'd like to ask what are yours daily or weekly routine? Maybe hearing other's processes can help beginners like me.

And also how do you manage not getting overwhelmed by so many resources? It can be as simple as picking one and going, or choosing the best given a personal reality.

Me, right now, am using Mimo and Sololearn as pocket treats and I'm reading and annotating Automatize the boring stuff with Python. I find that Android apps sometimes are obscure with theory, and sometimes complement each other, but I'm afraid to get burned out of it. The book though is much clearer, but don't have practice.

I think that the apps complement the book nicely, but I'm also wanting to watch MIT's course later.

It's a conceptual question that could fit any self-learning sub, but it is nice to have pointers from fellow programming learners.

A justification: I didn't feel like the FAQ had a close enough question. This is about meta-cognition, specifically about programming.",0,7,savage_northener,learnprogramming,4260470,2025-10-26 20:21:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1oguviq/whats_your_routine_and_how_do_you_manage_so_many/,False,False,False,False,0,"[""I'd suggest harvards free courses: CS50 (intro to CS, Python, Web dev)"", 'Back in my day I had to drive to the book store, spend way too much money on a book, read it and work through examples. And if there was a typo I had to figure it out on my own. Not much to be overwhelmed by.\n\nYou could try it if you want. I still actually love learning by working through books.', 'Just develop applications that you want to use yourself. When you get stuck research the area you need to make progress.', 'My daily study routine is usually just working on a project or following a tutorial or reading a book. And what I do to not get overwhelmed by so many learning resources is by learning through projects instead of through tutorials and courses. Whatever I want to learn, I just do a very quick research, learn the syntax, read some documentation and then jump into a project and build something little by little and learn more as I go. If you stick to learning through experience, you will not need to depend on a course being good at teaching, because you\'ll be mainly learning through the experience of building something from 0 to 100. Project-based learning is the best way to not overwhelmed or burned out or go through tutorial hell.\n\nIf you want to learn Python, sure yeah have your little resources here and there, but then you should also have a project in mind. You should be building something or at least wanting to build something. Don\'t depend on just a course or tutorial or app to teach you, no you can learn by yourself if you just build something from scratch.\n\nYou don\'t need so many resources, you need practice, you need to build problem solving skills, you need to learn how to write code idiomatically. For example, right now I\'m learning Go and yes I have some resources, for example right now I\'m reading ""Learning Go"" by Jon Bodner and ""100 Go Mistakes"" but I don\'t just use that to learn, I\'m also building an HTTP server, and then I\'ll build an API client for the terminal, and then I\'ll build a video game about my cute cat. I think that learning through projects is so much better than juggling 5 different learning resources and getting burned out. Programming is about problem solving, so to learn programming you have to solve problems, and projects are PERFECT for that. The best way to learn programming, is through hands-on experience.']"
